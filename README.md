# MatLAB: Modern Engineering Challenge :bicyclist:

MatLab is a cloud app :globe_with_meridians: that enables you to do basic mathematic calculations. 
The app is developed to demonstrate modern engineering practices.

## The Challenge
The challenge requires you to demonstrate your experience in coding, tooling and some best practices in modern systems engineering. During the challenge you develop a basic backend application (API) and deploy this into a real environment using DevOps practices. Furthermore, youâ€™ll need to provide some insights into your software development process using (dash)boards and reporting.
